### 宣布软件发布

**介绍**

任何开源项目的功能之一就是发布软件，目标是吸引尽可能多的用户。为了帮助项目取得成功，你需要确保及时用正确的信息向最广泛的相关受众分发您的发布新闻。

遵循一些协调发布公告的基本准则可以确保您的出色工作不会在混乱中迷失。请记住，这些只是指南；你的社区的做法可能会有所不同。

**通用准则**

- 不要把星期五或重要假期设置成发布日期。拥有最大覆盖率的理想发布日期是星期二。
- 如果可能的话，协调主发布版本与相关会议和活动。
- 定制发布公告和博客，以鼓励 _使用_ 软件以及 _贡献_ 软件。
- 阐述一个项目将如何使用户受益；解释好处而不是专注于技术细节。

**跟踪主要版本 X.0 的候选版本和最终版本**

**After all major releases and significant point releases**

1. Conduct a retrospective to see what, if anything, could be done to improve the next release
    cycle.

**Writing a press release/release announcement**

Writing and distributing a release announcement would seem relatively straightforward; however,
some strategies for doing this work are more effective than others. Specifically, you should write
your release announcement in a way that makes it most likely for a media outlet to pick it up.

Below is a template for a release announcement, with some guidelines. Please note that this is only
a guide; copying exactly what’s here may not be effective for your project.

Be direct and factual about information you share in public statements. Avoid hyperbole ("the
bestest project ever made!!!") and speculation ("the only project that can do this"). Media outlets
rapidly disregard such hyperbole and might avoid spreading the word about your release
altogether.


Release announcements are not opportunities to hype your project (as tempting as using them for
this purpose may be). You can and should take the opportunity to thank your hard-working
community. This gives credit to those who’ve done the work and emphasizes the free and open
source nature of the project.

Be clear and concise. Support your claims with facts. This will help get your announcement more
broadly disseminated.
